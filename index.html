        <div style="width:700px;display: block;"><h1>About OTFT: The Videogame</h1>
    <p>OTFT is a videogame about a humanoid nammed OTFT who grows up in a ruined future of the Earth, where there are little to no humans left. In the storyline, OTFT and his brother, BlooDerg, make desprate efforts to defend their village from inpending danger and OTFT slowly discovers himself and the full complete truth about his conception.</p>
    <p>This game is mainly a 2.5D platformer (2D playstyle, 3D visuals, and some 2D visuals), with a brouder focus on its story. This game includes 9 different areas, and 5 will be included in the upcoming demo for OTFT.</p>

He enjoys adventure and never flinches in the face of danger (or so he thinks). Loves to have a good fight with anyone. Hes very agile, quick, and he has fire powers (if that wasnt already obvious). OTFT lacks in using his head and sometimes doesn't play very smart in dire situations. Nevertheless, hes always willing to lend a helping hand to everyone (even if hes not very helpful) and will always enjoy a good fight.</p><p>Even though hes just a puny human, OTFT thinks very highly of himself and can tend to sometimes think hes better than everyone. But this doesnt get in the way of his devoted nature to his friends or family. He treats them with respect and loyalty, even if he thinks hes better. He's so devoted and loyal to them in fact, that he would be willing to sacrifice himself for them.</p>

            <h2>Warper</h2><img src="images/JJAvatar.png" style="width:300px;height:300px;"><div style="width:700px;background-color:#0000003d;color:white;"><p>Age: UNKNOWN</p><p>Date of Birth: UNKNOWN (Presumably January 1st)</p><p>IQ: 182</p><p>POSITIVE POWER: Earth Orb</p><p>NEGATIVE POWER: Poison Orb</p></div><p>Warper, or JJ, is the silly little red ball friend, the one who lifts the spirits of the trio. Warper comes from a completely different universe, one where his kind, the shape animals, used to thrive. But when their universe was destroyed, because they killed the wife of a very important galactic ruler, many of them were lost in time forever. Not Warper though, Warper was able to track down this mystery ruler to this universe and is actively searching for him. Catching up with OTFT and his brother, they team up briefly to track down who they think is this ruler, only to find out it was merely a decoy.</p><p>Warper used to rule over the shape animal kingdom in the previous universe for eons, protecting them from danger and generally being a leader. One of his more notable feats was defending the kingdom from a vicious shape named Phoenix. He was appointed into power by Warper, but this was quickly revoked when Phoenix created Roadkill and tried to cause mass genocide. Warper sealed away Phoenix for good.</p>

            <h2>BlooDerg</h2><img src="images/BlooAvatar.png" style="width:300px;height:300px;"><div style="width:700px;background-color:#0000003d;color:white;"><p>Age: 1,601</p><p>Date of Birth: December 28th, 1919</p><p>IQ: 255</p><p>POSITIVE POWER: ???</p><p>NEGATIVE POWER: Chaos Orb</p></div><p>Bloo is a very shy and quiet dragon. Spending most of his life alone, hes very anti-social and he only openly communicates with OTFT, his brother. He's only related to OTFT, a humanoid, because they share the DNA of the same father. Since Bloo was adopted as a pet into the same family as OTFT was adopted into, they grew up together and have been very close ever since. Since OTFT doesnt think, Bloo's the thinker for him. He's very smart, being over 1500 years old, and despite how nervous and sometimes overthinking he may be, he'll always find away.</p><p>Bloo is very sensitive and can get his feelings hurt relatively easy. He is also afraid of anything monsterous, despite the fact that he is a 7 foot tall dragon. Even so, and even though his skin is too strong to be stung, he has melissophobia, the fear of bees/wasps/hornets.</p>

            <h2>William Davidson</h2><img src="images/WillAvatar.png" style="width:300px;height:300px;"><div style="width:700px;background-color:#0000003d;color:white;"><p>Age: 15</p><p>Date of Birth: July 10th, 2042</p><p>IQ: 305</p><p>POSITIVE POWER: Brainpower Orb</p><p>NEGATIVE POWER: Voltage Orb</p></div><p>Will is a 15 year old genius who has spent his whole life researching the mysteries of the universe and gaining knowledge from a young age.</p><p>He played a massive role in the creation of OTFT, being aware of this galactic ruler before they did anything major, and essentially tricked them into creating the sole thing that would stop them without them even realizing at first. Will extracted the DNA of this ruler and used it to create OTFT, therefore making OTFT and BlooDerg brothers, since this ruler is BlooDerg's father. In the first game, Will plays as a spectator in the story, hovering over the 2 heroes and making sure they follow the correct path, and partially using Radeo to do so.</p>

            <h2>Galactia</h2><img src="images/GalactiaAvatar.png" style="width:300px;height:300px;"><div style="width:700px;background-color:#0000003d;color:white;"><p>Age: 17</p><p>Date of Birth: January 4th, 3504</p><p>IQ: 125</p><p>POSITIVE POWER: Ice Orb</p><p>NEGATIVE POWER: Fire Orb</p></div><p>Galactia is a very focused and determined individual with a one track mind for most of her time. She's willing to sacrafice anything for the greater good, even if that means killing her best friend. Sometimes, she may come off as an cold person, but she has a warm heart on the inside. In the game, she has been manipulated by the mysterious galactic ruler that governs the milky way and is set to kill OTFT, because she thinks that he has evil intentions, thus igniting their rivalry.</p><p>She was created by the galactic ruler as an opposite to OTFT to kill him from a futuristic reading said ruler had, to try and prevent OTFT from ruining his plans.</p>

        <div style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5);display: flex;flex-direction: row;flex-wrap: wrap;align-content: center;justify-content: space-around;align-items: center;border: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5);border-width: 5px;border-style: solid;">
            <h2>Radeo</h2><img src="images/RadeoAvatar.png" style="width:300px;height:300px;"><div style="width:700px;background-color:#0000003d;color:white;"><p>Age: 16</p><p>Date of Creation: February 17th, 3505</p><p>IQ: N/A</p><p>POSITIVE POWER: Voltage Orb</p><p>NEGATIVE POWER: Brainpower Orb</p></div><p>Radeo is a robot created by a William D., a 15 year old genius who played a part in the creation of OTFT, to play as a messanger and backup defense system for OTFT. He was programmed to warn the protagonists of the raid of ships incomming onto their small village, and to ready them for the immaculate task of defeating the galactic ruler with the intent to destroy the milky way. Radio himself plays no major roles in the first game outside of being a messanger and a guide.</p><p>Despite his purpose, he actually has a personality, based off of Bloo and OTFT. Radeo acts sort of hippie and most of his language is that of the 1980s, even though this timeline takes place in 3521. He considers ancient practices to be hip and cool even though that happened long before he was even concieved. Hes very laid back and takes life slowly, and only uses his strength whenever OTFT or Bloo are in danger, his sole purpose. His body looks were meant to appeal to OTFT and Bloo to seem inviting and so Will could connect with them. Ironically, they think Radeo is kinda weird, but they're completely cool with him.</p>
